Here's a simple idea for game matching clips to lines. It would be suitable for a beginning learner, 
and would serve primarily for getting used to the sound of the target language at a high-level.

This particular game would be monolingual, so we don't have to worry about alignment issues. I believe 
it could also be implemented in a "static" way (no db calls), either by generating multiple questions 
ahead of time or by somehow using Javascript to randomize them.

Lauren goes to the site, and clicks "matching game."  Then she sees a random clip from a PT movie, and 
a series of four or five lines. Her task is simply to click the line that corresponds to the clip. 

With a full-length movie, there could be a huge number of such exercises.  

This strikes me as the easiest possible game to create that would be beneficial. WDYT?
